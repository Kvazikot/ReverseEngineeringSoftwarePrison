 
A signal generator might be used to jam these frequencies. By using a sweep signal that 
ranges between 3600 MHz to 4000 MHz, it is possible to jam the tracking frequency and the 
harm & messaging frequency. One piece of equipment that is an example is the Agilent 
E8257D. The data sheet for this signal generator states that it has a maximum sweep rate of 
400 MHz per millisecond.That means that the entire range between 3600 to 4000 MHz can 
be swept 1000 times each second â€“ which makes for very effective signal jamming. 
 
Equipment is available that is less expensive than this model, and it is also possible to rent 
the equipment. By jamming the tracking frequency, they won't be able to follow you and that 
prevents the harm signal from ever reaching the target. I recommend saving the firmware for 
the equipment in a separate file, because the government criminals will try to disable it. By 
re-writing the firmware, it can undo the changes the criminals will try to make. Also save the 
firmware on a read-only device.
